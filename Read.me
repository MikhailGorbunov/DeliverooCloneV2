# Deliverro-clone: Food ordering Mobile App

<b> Contributors: [Mikhail](https://github.com/MikhailGorbunov) </b>

A full stack React Native mobile application (Android) that allows users to install on an Android phone, be able to search for a restaurant and menu, select food item and order. We will use Expo and a Firebase database to store the data.

<!-- restaurant bookings through their unique profile. They can browse restaurant availability, create/review/delete bookings, as well as adding restaurants to their favourites. The backend is built in Java with Spring. -->

<!-- ðŸš§ <b> NB: This is app has reached its MVP, but is still under construction</b> ðŸš§ -->

## Technologies

These are the main technologies we used to contruct the project.

- ![ReactNative]
- ![Java]
- ![Spring]
- ![Hibernate]
- ![PostgreSQL]
- ![IntelliJ_IDEA]
- React Native navigation
- Sanity
- Redux
- tailwind
- docker
- github

## Brief

Our initial brief was extremely ambitious, due to the face we underestimated the challenges we would encounter using React Native. Below is a revised version of that brief!

**MVP**

- [ ] Display recipes (with images)
- [ ] Be able to search cocktail recipe by name
- [ ] Be able to leave a comment under each recipe
- [ ] Data is stored in a database accessible through a RESTful API
- [ ] Have a README file with screenshots/videos and running instructions.

<!-- API find or make -->

**Extensions **

Some of the features currently in progress:

- [ ] Be able to leave a comment under each recipe
- [ ] Have a two colour scheme being both accessible (dark and light)
- [ ] Comments have tags
- [ ] Recipe can be searched by the tag
- [ ] Be able to search cocktail recipe by ingredient
- [ ] Calculate recipe portion
- [ ] Be able to login
- [ ] Be able to add recipe to a shopping list
- [ ] Be able to customize recipe

**Super Extensions **

- [ ] Create a shopping bot
- [ ] Be able to add recipe to a party planner
- [ ] Create an email invitation
- [ ] Add a cloud (Firebase) ![Firebase]
- [ ] Be able to make their own recipe
- [ ] To be able to upload the app to google play

## Challenges

Here are some of the things we've found difficult:

- Learning a new framework while planning & building
- Learning how Reactive Native works
- Making our database connect with our mobile app
- File structuring & naming conventions as the project scaled up in size
- Managing dependency and version issues
